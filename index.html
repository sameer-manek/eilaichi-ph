			Cooking food was a profound evolutionary effect which enabled humans to eat and digest food much quickly. While it was functional, we somehow managed to spice things up.. and there came, the recipies! A linear procedure to cook food with all the raw materials that anyone can follow and obtain similar results.. it was remarkable achievements for humans.
			<br /> <br />
			Extending that achievement, I am building a platform for you to share your recipies to the world! A new and customized platform to cater the needs of food bloggers (pun intended!).
